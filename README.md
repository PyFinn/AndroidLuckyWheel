Simple Lucky Wheel for Android Aplications

## About
This is a simple Android Studio Project containing a Lucky Wheel / Wheel of Fortune. Feel free to use the Code in your own Android Apps. The Project contains just one simple Java Class extending an AppCompatActivity which handles Button ClickÂ´s 
and cares about the Animation & Animation Result stuff. The code is kept quite simple and is built for flexibility, you can easily implement your own Wheel Designs with putting them into your drawable folder (should be .png), the ranges
can be edited easily.
